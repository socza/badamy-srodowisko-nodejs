# Run the program with the command - "node program.js".

# You have three options in the program.

# 1. Command "env" - this is information about our environment, which is what NodeJS sees as the environment in which it was launched.

# 2. The  "ver" command - displays information about the NodeJS itself as well as components and dependencies, including the V8 engine on which the NodeJS is built.

# 3. The "exit" command - it exit the program.
