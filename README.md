# Run the program with the command - "node program.js".

# You have three options in the program.
# 1. Command "env" - this is information about our environment, which is what Node.js sees as the environment in which it was launched.
# 2. Command "ver" - displays information about the Node itself as well as components and dependencies, including the V8 engine on which the Node is built.
# 3. Command "exit" - it exits the program.
